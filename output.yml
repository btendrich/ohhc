    U862 (sibling of U863 and 864)
    "D" is a very caring, helpful young man. He is a wonderful big brother. He always made sure the younger siblings or children were taken care of before himself. He had a blast going to the beach, great with animals (especially loves dogs) playing out side, anything batman related, and playing cards or video games with the family. He is a skilled athlete at "football" and it would be his dream to ride in a Dodge Charger one day. He was an absolute joy to be around and loved to help in the kitchen with cooking too. D" spoke English very well, and has a smile that lights up the room and kept us all laughing with his charming fun personality

    U863 (sibling of U862 and U864)
    This little guy is full of spunk and big hugs. He loves super hero's and would put on a cape and run like "The Flash". He is full of energy and loved being outside playing in the backyard, going fishing, swimming, and playing with animals. He and his brother and sister would  all play "football" together and enjoyed playing games or watching cartoons in the evening to wind down. He would always offer to help carry in groceries and wanted to help in the kitchen with cooking and loves eating ice cream. At night, he liked to be tucked in and would play quietly in the morning till his big brother would wake up. "D"   is a fun little guy who wants to be a super hero when he  grows up and very well could be one day.

    U864 (sister of U863 and U862)
    "K" is so sweet and a tiny bit shy until you get to know her, then she is all giggles and grins. She loves playing dress-up, being pampered and cuddling up to read a story or watch a moving. She's very smart and loves learning new things like how to swim or read English. She quickly learned her ABC's in English and learned new words with ease. "K" is so easy going  and laid back. She loved to be girly, but would also play in the dirt with the boys. She would do wonderfully with another girl to play baby dolls with or to do arts and crafts. "K" would love to ride a horse one day and can't wait to come back to America again.

  :description: "$800 Scholarship!\nL105   (written by past host family): \nK is a
    sweet and adventurous girl.  She absolutely loves to try new things and even when
    she’s scared she will push through.  K got along with our entire family (we have
    3 kids ranging from 9-14 years old).  She absolutely adores dogs and cats.  Especially
    cats.  If you have a cat, then K is your girl. She is responsible and respectful.
    \ Her English is good, better than she gives herself credit.  K does everything
    in her power to communicate effectively.  She would do great with a family that
    spends time at home with occasional outings and adventures, because she does enjoy
    resting too.  She has brothers and she does worry about them, so hosting her with
    a brother or 2 would be best and I know she would help tremendously with their
    care.  K can have moments where her emotions overflow because she can be particular
    about things.  But after a few moments she moves on and is back to her normal
    self.  We love this girl and want nothing more than for her and her brothers to
    find a family."

    "A" says his friends would describe him as a "rascal". He is an active boy who likes cartoons, biking, rollerblading, basketball, jumping on the trampoline and to build houses, cars and airplanes with legos. He loved the fidget spinner that we gave him at the end of the interview and gave us a huge smile when he caught a ball that was thrown to him.

    "J" is the littlest brother of this sibling trio. He was full of smiles! He likes the country, to build with legos and play with puzzles. He would prefer to be the youngest child in his Christmas home. When asked what his favorite food is he excitedly replied, "Rolton" which is Latvian Raman.

    a beautiful 15 year old boy who loves soccer, Minecraft, music, electronics and
    animals.  He is active, but mostly just wants to be engaged regardless of he activity!
    \ He is very shy around new people and was most comfortable and seemed to blossom
    with our immediate family.  His personality is silly, funny and sweet.  He is
    thoughtful and very sensitive, although he tries to hide his emotions with people
    he does not know.   O is very intelligent. He has taught himself how to fix electronics
    and build batteries!  I feel he was craving attention from both my husband and
    I. He would wait for my husband to come home and be there ready to say hello.
    O was helpful around the house, fed and walked the dogs, helped cook dinner and
    was able to entertain himself when I needed to complete chores around the house.
    This boy is really in need of a family that can give him a sense of safety. His
    behavior is mostly on par with his age, but at times his play and emotional age
    can present a little younger. O shared some of his past with us and his hopes
    for a forever family."

    is an amazing young man who immediately integrated well into his summer host family.
    He was comfortable interacting and playing with each of them and easily fell into
    their daily routine. \nHe loves nerf guns, swimming, animals, bey blades, and
    basketball; but, he LOVES baseball the best. D was happiest when at the field,
    learning to hit, catch, and run. \nHis English has improved greatly and he demonstrates
    a real aptitude and desire to learn new things. He is openly affectionate and
    loves to cuddle, especially to watch a movie. He responds well to correction when
    needed and understands visual cues. \nHe eats well, his favorite food (other than
    pelmini) is hot dogs. While vegetables are not his first preference he is willing
    try them. He loves strawberries and cherries and will also eat apples. He cleans
    up after himself when asked. \nD would thrive in a positive, structured, loving
    environment."

    “A” is the youngest of this sibling group of five and absolutely adorable.  She likes all foods except fish. She likes to draw, ride a bike, inline skate and to catch butterflies.  She loves stuffed animals and dolls, and made a bed out of a shoebox for a stuffed animal she received from your team.   She would love to own her own pet … and hopes for a dog someday. She is very excited to be starting school this year and is in the first grade. She would like to catch fish in America. She initially said her one wish would be a pet rat, but then decided that she would really like to swim and live underwater.  When she grows up, she wants to be a "mama"!

    “J” is part of  the adorable sibling group of 5. She likes Latvian classes in school and loves playing computer games, reading books, singing and dance. She also plays the piano and played a bit for our team! She is very sweet and talkative, eager to interact. She had great eye contact during the interview and her foster mom reports she is a very good, trustworthy girl.  If she is hosted, she would like to make snowmen and have a snowball fight in America. She likes fish, especially salmon!   As far as animals, she loves dogs and cats but is afraid of spiders and bees.  She enjoyed interacting with therapy dogs they had at school in the past.  She would like to be a dentist when she grows up.

He likes all animals, but cats are his favorite. They have a house cat whom he adores and is very gentle with. He said that if he found $20 he would give it to his house mom. His one wish is the same as what he wants to be in the future; to be a basketball coach for children.

    “S” is a shy, sweet, quiet boy who just arrived at the orphanage. He presents much younger than his actual age. He told the team he enjoys playing on the computer, playing with legos and in general prefers to be inside rather than outside. A holiday season spent with a family making cookies or doing crafts inside could be just the thing this sweetheart needs to blossom. Could that be your family this Christmas?

    “O” describes herself as a good student who loves art. Her dream is to visit the mountains where she could draw amazing nature scenes. She would especially love to camp out in a tent and see the stars. She is a little afraid of the dark but thinks it wouldn’t be so scary if she was with a family. She would like to be in a family with kids but doesn’t mind if they are older or younger than her. Could you be the one to show this sweet girl the beauty of nature and the beauty of a family?

    “S” loves bears! Any kind of bear. He says he is not afraid of them at all! The only thing he said might scare him a little bit is jellyfish but even that doesn’t deter him from wanting to see the ocean. When he grows up he would like to be a pilot because he loves the uniform! This young guy is definitely a bit delayed for his age and has had some rough times but more than anything he would like to be chosen to visit America. Could you make his wish come true?

    heart. He would benefit greatly from being in a family for Christmas as he and
    his twin brother spent most of their life in an institution. According to teacher,
    he is smart and is in a higher grade than most kids his age. He was very articulate,
    confident and polite and sat patiently waiting for his turn. He says he loves
    Lego and loves animals. He says he is a \" big boy and is scared of nothing\"
    When asked what he likes to eat, he said salami and pastrami and candy, I could
    not agree more!  He has a lot of friends and gets along well with others. He likes
    riding a bike and says he can swim a little. He is excited about a possibility
    of traveling to US and said he was not concerned about flying or his ability to
    communicate as he knows how to read and wright. Overall, he was pure joy to interview
    and would make any families Christmas extra special. His twin brother is unable
    to travel as he has  disabilities and requires extra supervision.  Please consider
    R to join your family and show this little love bug what family quality time is
    all about"

    "V" is a nice polite 3rd grader who  has been in his current school for several years but never had a chance to travel. He was patient and radiated positive energy during the interview. He is a good student and likes to write. He says he loves to play with cars and Lego as well as eat apples, carrots,  buckwheat and pastrami. When asked if he has any fears, he said " super enormous spiders, otherwise nothing". Otherwise he loves animals and would enjoy a family with " lots of kids and pets". He wants to be a driver when he grows up and his dream is to have a family as well as a car he could drive his family around in. He says he is excited to see the ocean but not sure if he wants to swim in it " because that is where the sharks are". "V" was good with his little brother and was polite during an interview. He was somewhat active in the room, having to wait for his turn extended period of time, but not disruptive or disrespectful. He would be a blessing to a family during his holiday season. He has a younger brother who is too little to travel.

    “M” is a 3rd grader whose favorite class is Math. He’s a good student and likes school. He also loves basketball, soccer and boxing. He says his friends would describe him as being active, fun and full of energy. His favorite superhero is superman and he would love to be in a family with kids his age or younger. If he was granted one wish he would buy a big house for he and his friends to live in. He really enjoyed being interviewed and was excited to talk about the possibility of going to America. He also showed the team some pretty cool acrobatics on the trampoline. Your Christmas will be extra exciting with this sweet boy in it.

  :description: U1158 " L" is a sweet little 2nd grader who is small for his age.
    He has been in his current school for a little over a year and teacher highly
    recommended him. He has never traveled before and would love a chance to spend
    holidays with a family. "L" has overcome significant struggles early in life including
    severe speech impediment, he was non verbal according to a teacher even a year
    ago. He was able to communicate with me and listened and followed directions well.
    He had such kind and endearing demeanor about him!  "L" loves to play with Lego,
    puzzles and be around other kids. He has a lot of friends and was able to tell
    me a little bit about them. He is scared of larger dogs, otherwise likes animals.
    He would be a loving addition to any family over the holidays.

  :description: U 1129  "V" is a sweet and smiley 3rd grader who was ready with hugs
    and great presence. She has been in her current school for over a year and her
    teachers describe her " loving and fun and sweet but a so-so student "  She loves
    math, art and music. According to a director " She really really really wants
    to go and asks every day when will the interview team will come?"  She never had
    a chance to travel in the past and is looking forward to spending Christmas with
    a family. " V " loves music and " used to play violin and take dance lessons when
    I was little". Her dream is to become a violin player or massage/ physical therapist.
    She loves to play outside and prefers company of other girls. She loves Pizza,
    french fries and hot dogs. Speaking of dogs, she had a negative experience with
    a large dog while in foster care and she is uncomfortable around larger dogs as
    a result. She does not have any other fears and would be a joy to have as part
    of your family through the holiday season. She appears to have possible very mild
    cognitive delay that does not seem to affect her communication abilities or personality.

    “M” told the interview team that out of all the animals in the world kangaroos are his favorite and he knows a lot about them. If he had one wish he would use it to visit a zoo and see them in real life. When he grows up he dreams of being a soccer star but he really wanted to make sure we understood that above everything he wants the chance to visit America and spend time in a real family. Do you live nearby a zoo? Could you show this young boy what family life looks like this Christmas?

    and said if he would find $20, he would spend it on buying gifts to his family.
    He prefers to be with kids his own age and would love a chance to ride a roller
    coaster and an airplane. " D" says he loves animals and " not sacred of anything"
    He wants to be a IT specialist when he grows up but for now he wants to belong
    and to spend holidays with a family.

    and gets good grades. He hopes that studying hard will help him become a millionaire
    one day! When he isn’t studying he likes to have fun. “M” loves to play outside
    and really enjoys any kind of sports! He has several friends to play with and
    they say “M” always helps them when they need it. He does have one wish but was
    a little too shy to share it. A little later in the interview he did let it slip
    that he really wants to live in America. For now, though, he’ll be happy to get
    a chance to visit and see all the beautiful things here, and maybe ride a rollercoaster!
    Throughout the interview he talked excitedly about all the interesting facts he
    knew about America. He asked some really great questions. “M” is a really sweet
    boy who would thrive in a safe, loving family. He deserves the chance to be part
    of a family who will help him when he needs it too."

    "B" is a sweet 7th grader who has only been in the current school for 3 days but was doing surprisingly well, considering how new he is. "B " never traveled before and would like an opportunity to spend Christmas in US. He was calm, quiet and polite and says he would love to see and swim in the ocean. He likes to bike and play soccer. He says he gets along well with others but prefers smaller families and not too much noise or commotion. He says he likes just about any food and also enjoys gardening in his free time. If suddenly would be presented with money, he would buy new sneakers. He wants to be a builder when he grows up and cant wait to have a chance to spend holidays with loving family.

    His smile was contagious and just lit up the room! The staff said he is an orphanage
    favorite and I could see why. He beamed the whole time we were talking, happy
    to tell us how eager he is to help around his school. He loves helping the younger
    children with their chores, like doing laundry and ironing. He also knows how
    to ride horses and enjoys riding as a pastime. He said his favorite class at school
    is computers and he enjoys helping make slideshows for presentations. \nAlthough
    this young man has had surgery for a cleft lip and still has cleft palate issues
    which cause him some difficulty with pronunciation, he doesn't let that impede
    his outgoing personality! He's quite talkative!\n\"V\" does have hydrocephalus
    which is being managed. He loves animals and says he's not picky about what kind
    of family he would spend the summer with. He said he'd just enjoy seeing how others
    live. Please consider hosting \"V\" this summer and giving him the opportunity
    of a lifetime!"

     "A" this younger teen boy came highly recommended by staff. He was described as " a very good boy " by his caregiver. He was sweet and polite. He loves school, especially PE and seemed more comfortable speaking Russian, not Ukranian. He is brand new to this school but is already making friends. He is athletic and has been participating in swimming competitions.  He would love to have a chance to travel to US and spend holiday with a family. He gets along well with others and loves younger kids. His dream is to get new vision glasses as his current once are lost and to have a chance to ride a roller coaster. He is not sure who he wants to be when he grows up, but he appeared to give it a real thought prior to answering. He might have a very mild cognitive delay based on his speech but it does not seem to affect his personality or good nature. He would be blessed with a chance to have a family to care for him over the holidays.

Teacher told us that "M" is very eager to have a chance to travel to US but is shy and is not good at advocating for herself when she is nervous. She says she is scared of dark but otherwise she has no fears. She loves animals and likes " hanging out with friends outside". If found 20 $ she said she would give it to her teacher. She wants to be a hairdresser when she grows up. She would benefit from loving family that could help her to boost her self esteem as well as provide structure and guidance ( according to a teacher, she was accused of taking an item that was not hers but it was not proven one way or another)

    “M” is an amazing girl. She is a typical teen in that she loves social media, playing on her phone and hanging out with her friends. However beyond regular teen activities she told the interview team that she wants to do something that matters with her life. She told us she loves to communicate and negotiate and that she would like to earn a business degree. When asked what she would do if she found $20 she said she would find an older person in need and help them out. At the end of the interview when asked if she had any questions for the team she asked to interview each team member individually about their families and their lives. This girl is going places but could really use the love of a family to give her a head start.

    “A” is studying to be a travel agent. She is strong, positive and dedicated to her studies. She says her friends would describe her as fun, generous and kind. She has an eye for fashion and knows where to find the bargains. She said if she found $20 she would spend it at a local store where they are selling t-shirts for $4/each! Between travel time and classes she spends 12 hours a day on her studies but when she is free she enjoys sleeping, watching movies and shopping! This sweet girl could really use some one on one love and attention this Christmas.

    This girl is very musical! She plays the violin, and enjoys singing and dancing. She has even competed to display her talents. She is a good student, and she does know some English.  Her desire is to visit a theme park and a concert (especially violin). She has had many losses in her life and would benefit from a family who has time to spend with her.

    She was hosted this past summer and did very well. She enjoyed all of the activities the family participated in, especial going to Broadway plays. She is an age appropriate teen girl who likes fashion, makeup, and the company of other teens.

    This young man was an interview team favorite. Kind and polite with an incredible smile. He held the door for us and helped us carry our things. He loves to work with his hands. Whether it be carpentry or tile making or machine work. Anything he can build he loves! He has been offered before but never chosen and he made sure to tell us that if he is chosen this time he will do anything he is asked and he will be helpful every day.

  :description: "U1303, U1304 \nThese two boys are full of energy and smiles. The
    oldest boy is physically smaller than the middle brother but definitely in charge
    of all three. Their size and demeanor make them seem younger than their actual
    age. Middle brother loves Ninjago and older brother loves computer games like
    “Royal Quest”. Even though they have only been at the orphanage a short time they
    were very excited by the prospect of a trip to America. They have another younger
    brother who is too young to travel this year (who our team met). These boys would
    do well with a physically active family that could keep up with their boundless
    energy."

    U479 and U480
    This sweet sibling pair has just been added to our list! They have traveled in the past, and those who spent time with them has nothing but positive things to say. Don't miss out on this special sibling set----and don't let them miss the chance to share in family life this summer.

  :description: U480 - "O"  is also very sweet and always smiling. He relies on his
    sister and translator apps, but we are coming to notice that he knows more English
    than he feels comfortable speaking. He is building confidence and speaking in
    English more to us each day. I think our feeble attempts at Russian may be boosting
    his confidence. He really likes board games and loves hide and seek! He enjoys
    riding bikes, being outdoors. and he swims well. He is very fond of American food.
    He enjoys the small things like a trip to the store or checking the mail, and
    he is always the first person out to the car to greet his host parents when they
    would arrive home.  His sister is UK479 "V"

    draw, study, and write poetry. She enjoys nature and likes to go for a run in
    the mornings. She has also enjoyed swimming.  Her brother "O" is UK480

    U 1127 U. " M" is a sweet teen boy who is an older brother of U 1126. He is relatively new to this school but came highly recommended by staff due to his good nature. He never traveled before and would love a chance to spend Christmas with his brother in a Christian family. He brought tears to interview team eyes when he said he wishes he could eat potato pancakes one day again because that reminds him of his grandma who used to make them and who he loved very much. His not a picky eater but does not like liver :)  . He enjoys outdoors and would love a chance to go fishing. He is a good student and says he does not mind to follow directions and is " never in trouble because I listen well and like to help". He was calm, kind and patient as well as clearly protective and sweet with his little brother. He was respectful and tactful during interview and did not interrupt his brother at all ( he later corrected some statements his brother made but in a kind way as to not hurt his feelings.) When asked how his friends
     would describe him, he said " calm and share well with others". His one true wish was " forever family". He likes soccer, swimming and riding a bike. He likes cats and dogs and prefers family that has other children but " not too noisy". He says at times he gets overwhelmed by too much activity and likes quite time as well as sports.

    U1126.U
     I. is a sweet pre-teen boy who is a younger brother of U1127. He was a lot of fun and comes highly recommended by teachers. He was described by them as friendly, very compliant and " helpful, always trying to help and agrees with most things as to not upset people" He is relatively new to this orphanage but already won the hearts of his caregivers.  He had a strong connection with his brother during an interview and clearly looks up to him. "I." said he is very excited to travel and see " nice people". He wants to be an astronaut but does say he is scared of dark and will need a night light on when in space :). He loves cats and dogs and other kids but does say he prefers not to have a very large family as he ,at times , gets tired of a lot of noise and likes quite one on one time with few special people.  "I" might have mild speech processing delay as he answered yes to several questions that his older brother later clarified as incorrect. It does not prevent him at all from being kind and happy. Teachers described him as class favorite due to his good nature and kind disposition. He and his brother would benefit greatly from that one on one special time they crave so much

    told us he would like to be a chef and little sister quickly broke into that conversation
    to tell a story about a cooking disaster involving his attempt to make eggs. He
    was a little embarrassed but agreed that he might need some cooking lessons. A
    boy with a tender heart for younger children, when a younger boy dropped all of
    his candy on the ground “S” replaced the candy with his own bag.\n”V” is a beautiful
    teenage girl who likes to listen to music with friends…and maybe take a selfie
    or two. She also enjoys creating hairstyles with her best friend.  She’s nervous
    around dogs (many dogs in her country are strays). When asked what her favorite
    food is she stated that she could live on sausage, bread, and water forever. \nThese

    U627/214 (brother of U628/215)
    S is as cut energetic little boy. He loves to wrestle, play games, swim and cuddle. This kid is a cuddle bug! He likes to do math with his sister which is pretty impressive.  S does will with my boys,  but I think he would thrive if there wasn't a boy the same age as him in the house. He gets  along great with my 5 yr old and 2 yr old. Bot h the children love animals and  I think our dogs have been a comfort to them.

    D is an eleven yr old girl going on 16! She loves to shop, do her nails, crafts and swim. When she is shy in large groups, she light up at the house. She is smart, helpful, kind and all thing typical of a pre-teen girl. D does well with all the little kids in the house but I think she would thrive if she had a sister a few years older or younger than her. She does great with our 2 yr old. (D also has a 3 yr old sibling too young  to travel)

    U1008 (sister of U1007)
    D is a bouncing ball of sweetness! She has been a true blessing to our family this summer.  She was the baby in our house and got lots of extra attention. She has an older brother and interacts great with him with only minimal fighting. D loves to play outside on a swing set, bounce on a trampoline, and swim, but she is also able to sit still inside for hours painting, playing video games, or doing crafts. She is secure enough to go into  a Sunday school class on her won and loved VBS while her. She is a princess and loves to have her hair blown dry at night and styled in the morning. Pretty dress and glitter tennis shoes are a must! She listens well to  my son at night when he reads to he (Ukrainian Bible) and shows great comprehension skills. However, like her brother she struggles with reading and writing in her native language---yet she has picked up English great. She is somewhat of a pick eater. Over all she is a pure joy to be around and any family who hosts her will be blessed for sure!

    "I" is a sweet teen boy who enjoyed being in a family and craves attention. He will often grab our hands and hold them and gives big hugs. He interacts well with his sister with little fighting. I is a typical teenage boy in some ways -- He enjoys being outside jumping on the trampoline, going fishing, playing games like Jenga, and doing anything with water. He keeps his room very clean and helps around the house without being asked to. He especially enjoyed mowing the grass. and working in the garden. He is a great eater. "I" has limited literacy skills, and would benefit from a family that can spend additional time with his special needs. Past host family would be happy to speak to families about "I" and his sister.

    U1230, U1231

    These brothers made our team laugh… they were so excited to hear more about American foods and are dreaming of the chance to taste all different types; especially french fries.  Older brother, “S”, is confident and heard not only about American foods from friends but how exciting roller coasters are and he would love to ride one.  He enjoys being active and you can find him out on the soccer field when he is not in school.  His favorite class is Ukrainian language and he would appreciate an opportunity to improve his English.  Younger brother “Y” has a memorable smile that sets you at ease.  He is very friendly and enjoys being outside playing all types of sports.  He is sociable and has a lot of friends.  He loves to tinker and learn about how things work which is why he would like to become a mechanic when he grows up.  Could you invite these boys home to experience the love of a family this Christmas?  And of course, serve them french fries.

    " B " is an older brother to 1136. He was very respectful and polite and eager to interview. "B " never had an opportunity to travel and he would love a chance to go to US for Christmas. B is personable and honest and did not put on airs. When asked about school , this  9th grader said he is an " average student, I can do better if I try" .  He does like math, particularly algebra and geometry. He enjoys soccer and ping-pong and listening to music but you will not catch him dancing :) He says he would  love to become a professional soccer player and live in US and play on a team. If find $20 he would buy a soccer ball or something for the family. Surprising for a teen boy, just like his brother, he said he loves babies and would not mind at all if family has young kids. He loves nature and is hoping  to spend sometimes outdoors as well as ride a roller coaster

  :description: "U808, 809,and 1224 (sibling set)\nU808 \"S' is the big sister and
    was hosted by herself this summer as your younger brothers could not travel. Now
    they would like a chance to come together.\nPast host family writes this:\"S\"
    is such a sweet young lady! She is very shy and quiet at first, but really opens
    up once she gets more comfortable. She is very good with children (was great with
    our toddler), and says she wants to be a teacher when she grows up. She was hosted
    alone, but is obviously very close to her brothers, and she spoke of them often
    and with much affection. \n\n\"S\" is surprisingly well behaved, and has very
    good manners. She says her grandmother taught her etiquette, and her leaders in
    the children's home instill the same principles. \"S\" is very much a girly girl,
    and loves doing hair and makeup, and takes advantage of any excuse to dress up
    :) During our toddler's nap time, \"S\" would usually go to her room and read
    or take a nap herself. She seems to recharge with a daily 'alone time'. In the
    children's home, she said she reads her Bible every day during quiet time, and
    she very much loved going to church here, especially learning the songs. She would
    then come home and ask us to play the same songs on Youtube, and soaks them in
    like a happy little sponge.\n\n809 “I” is the middle brother.  He enjoys playing
    soccer and running outside or taking train and car rides. If inside he plays with
    dominos and doesn’t watch TV. He said his favorite foods are pizza and coffee!
    His one wish is to get a good education and to be a train conductor."

    U1308, U1309, U1310 (sibling set)

    Meet “D”, “V”, and “A”! They’ve had a hard life and experienced more than any person ever should in just a few short years but despite their rough start they are moving forward with amazing courage. “D” is the older sister. Her favorite subject is geometry but her real passion is singing! She says that sometimes being the bigger sister can be tough; she feels very protective of her brothers and has felt pressure to keep them safe. But her little brother wants to hug her everyday and sometimes a girl just needs her space! “A” is the youngest of the three. He enjoys all things boy and is very happy that there are lots of boys his age to play with in the orphanage! His favorite subject is PE because he loves being able to play outside. During the interview he was given a few pieces of candy and later we saw him sharing his candy with some of the younger kids. He also received an ice cream from one of the caretakers and offered it to me when he realized I didn’t have one! He is truly an amazing kid with a huge heart! The middle sibling is “V”. During the official interview he was at a camp but one of our coordinators knows him well. She says that “V” is very kind. The way he carries himself and the care he takes with the other children in the orphanage caught her eye immediately. He is respectful with the caretakers and visitors and compassionate towards the younger children. He gets along well with everyone in the orphanage and was never seen teasing some of the children with disabilities. Like his little brother, “V” also enjoys being outside and playing with the other kids. His caretakers say he does well in school despite being slightly behind when he first arrived at the orphanage 1.5yrs ago. He also needed surgery last year to correct a vision problem but he didn’t let that slow him down! He’s making great strides and tries hard to do well. All three children have overcome so much but they are not letting their past define them. They continue to have hope that their future will be bright and they deserve the opportunity to learn about healthy family life this Christmas. We all know that this mission improves the lives of the children it serves but hosting these siblings this winter would forever change your family’s life in the best, most unimaginable ways possible.

    U1225, U1226, U1227
    Easy to smile and laugh with our interview team, these beautiful sisters are very close, describing each other as best friends.  “Y” is the oldest.  She is a budding artist and enjoys drawing.  She would love the opportunity to discover other art mediums.  Her friends characterize her as helpful and trustworthy.  She also has a heart for caring for others which is why she would love to be a nurse.  She has a streak for adventure and would like to try new activities such as parachuting… maybe you can make a compromise and take her on a roller coaster? “L” is the middle sister.  She is very thoughtful and more reserved than her older sister.  Her favorite pastime is drawing.  She is very curious and likes to learn and does well in school.  She expressed the desire to learn to cook.  When we asked her what should dreams of doing, she answered, “Oh anything in America!” “O” is the baby of the group.  She is shy and kept flashing our team the sweetest smiles.  She adores taking care of younger children and is described as having a big heart and being kind to others.  She would like for a mom or dad to show her how to cook as she would like to be a chef when she grows up. What a sweet group of girls to bless your family this Christmas.  Could you welcome them into your family?

    pong, swimming and rollerblading.  He did well with his younger siblings over

  :description: “V"is a very sweet girl and loves art and reading.  She picked up
    on English so  quickly while here too! She also loves the outdoors and enjoys
    swimming, biking, jumping on the trampoline and coloring with chalk.  She did
    have some difficulty adjusting when she first arrived because she is used to being
    mom to her two younger siblings. After a couple weeks when she realized she could
    ease up on that responsibility,  she started treating them much more nicely.  Temper
    tantrums had been a problem but definitely decreased with time.

    "P" is a character and definitely had our hearts. He is funny and tries desperately to get what he wants. He is loving and loves to cuddle and get attention. He definitely needs a momma and a daddy who can invest time in him and show him he is important and loved. He ride a bike for the first time when he was with us and did so well! He also loved cornhole and skateboarding, movies and ping pong.

    This sweet princess was quiet but not shy. When asked if there was anything she would like to do or see she told us she would love to go to the circus especially to see the clowns. And she would also be excited to see crocodiles and snakes. She is definitely not a thrill seeker though and prefers to stay far away from rollercoasters! She would love to spend the holidays crafting, cookie making and making lots of sweet memories.

     “V” is a very pretty, personable girl. She is a little shy at first but starts to warm up and show her beautiful smile. Once she feels comfortable she is very talkative and sweet and told our team that she has heard so much about America from other kids who have traveled. She has a lot of friends at school and enjoys dancing. A family who traveled to her orphanage spoke of her love for animals, not one in particular, but all.  They also spoke of her kindness for others.  They took her to her first restaurant, ever, where she enjoyed an ice cream sundae. She would enjoy being hosted by any type of family. She likes to draw, listen to music and hopes to be a hairdresser someday. Our team commented on her super personality.

    1220 - ON HOLD TEA
    This bright eyed girl loves horses. She would jump at the chance to learn to ride. She loves helping with younger kids and would be super happy to have younger host siblings. Her friends describe her as being very friendly.  She is a little nervous to travel across the ocean but her one wish is to know what life would be like with a mom so despite the nerves she is excited at the possibility of spending time in a family. Her laugh and smile are infectious and any family would be blessed to have her join them for this Christmas season.

    ON HOLD - TEA U1300
    This teen boy has a confidence that drew the interview team in immediately. He shared with us that he is very interested in computers and IT but also likes playing basketball and soccer. He loves to draw all kinds of things and is a bit of a perfectionist in trying to copy drawings he finds on the internet. He would prefer being in a small family but doesn’t really mind if the other kids are older or younger than him. His smile lit up the room but he would really shine in a family of his own. Could that be your family this Christmas?

    This blonde haired blue eyed charmer is sure to make your Christmas sweet! He told us he loves anything remote controlled and while he admitted he does sometimes get in trouble for not going to sleep on time he does try his best to be good! This sweet boy would love nothing more than to know the love of a family this Christmas!

    A simple picture can’t adequately convey the pure joy that shines from this teen girl. She talks a mile a minute and was not short on answers to our interview questions. She says she understands more english than she speaks and is excited to learn more. She loves hanging out with her friends but also enjoys helping younger children. Her one wish is to travel abroad and she would be happy exploring the sights and sounds of a big city. The family that hosts this girl will be truly blessed this Christmas.

    An easy-going sibling set with a sweet relationship. Big sister was the most talkative but both lit up and were excited to talk about their desire to visit an amusement park. Little brother declared himself not scared of anything and willing to ride the biggest and scariest ride while big sister said she would like to go but might be too scared to actually ride. Both kids like animals but she really loves cats. Both of them also love jumping on the trampoline and being outside. When asked to describe her brother she stated he is fun, kind and hard working. When asked to describe his sister he said that she is the boss and he doesn’t like it when she makes fun of his haircut. These two sweethearts would be so much fun this Christmas!

    to watch movies like Harry Potter, or spend time with friends.  He speaks English
    well.  Another host mom who knows him describes him as, "kindhearted, friendly,
    and eager to please. He’s not afraid to show you his humor and spunk though! He
    will fill your winter with adventure and keep you on your toes but also has a
    kind and gentle side that desires a strong relationship with a mom figure." He
    enjoys video games, Pokémon Go! and fortnight. He also likes to swim in the local
    rivers. Younger brother "J"  loves his art class.  He also likes soccer and IronMan,
    and hopes to become a policeman someday.  He likes pets and animals, but admits
    spiders creep him out!   Their wish is to go to America and have a nice family.  Could
    that be your family?

    V is an absolutely wonderful girl. She loves hugs and attention. In many ways she is a tomboy, but also loves to do nails, hair and makeup. She is pretty good at sports and can challenge any boy. She can be very good with small children and many times is willing to help out with them. She is very responsible and can be trusted with the household. Although sometimes she gets loud with her sister, there has never been a problem resolving any disagreements between them. She is also  very brave and many time is up to trying new things. In her spare time V enjoys listening to music and reading books. Would be a great fit with any family, and especially enjoys kids near her age.

    V is loving and intelligent. He loves to swim, play outside and really enjoys music. He is open to all kinds of foods (isn't a picky eater). He is always eager to help do dishes, laundry or learning to mow the lawn. He gets along well with other children and loves dogs. He has struggled to communicate due to a speech impediment, but worked on improving his pronunciation. He always repeats word in English. He is polite and follow the rules such as picking up after himself , going to bed when told and showering when asked. With a loving family he will grow into a wonderful individual. This little guy stole the hearts of all who met him this summer!

    shy girl. She speaks Russian as her first language and some English. She loves
    to hang outside with friends, play dodge ball and enjoys games on her phone. She
    shared with us that she loves little kids and would enjoy a family that has pets.
    Her favorite foods are potato’s, pork filet, pasta with cheese and ketchup, but
    does not like rice or mushrooms. She believes her friends would describe her as
    helpful, smart and kind. J would love the chance to visit America again. We think
    she would make a wonderful addition to any family for Christmas."

    He is an amazing young man who enjoys sports, reading the encyclopedia to learn
    about animals and their environment, documentaries and to do experiments. He appears
    to be very intellectual and inquisitive. When asked what his one wish would be
    he responded, “for three more wishes!”  He likes to talk about his sister’s talents,
    explained that she was shy and advocated for her and helped her answer questions.
    He speaks Latvian, English and is learning French. Wood working in Home EC is
    his favorite subject at school. He would like to visit a zoo and his favorite
    animal is a leopard. His eyes lit up when we described an aquarium and asked if
    that was something he would like to see. He enthusiastically said, “yes”!"

    U625/212 "N" is full of joy! She giggles all the time and her laughter is contagious. She is playful and loves hugs and holding hands. She likes to get cozy on the couch and snuggle and it is not uncommon to hear "I love you" throughout the day. N enjoys being outside, riding her bike and swimming. She is also very talented at cross-stitch. (She told us she taught herself!) She interacts well with young children, enjoys goofing off and playing wit them, but does seem to get annoyed when they cry or act up. She would do well in a family with kiddoes' around her age. h ultimately just wants to be loved and, given time, I think she has the ability to adapt to any family. N tests the boundaries a little bit, but I think that is just typical for her age. She complies to the rules after a few unsuccessful attempts to sway us. She is easy to love and fun to be around.

    and ping pong. Like his brother, his one wish is for a forever family. He hopes
    they would be a sporty family and other kids are fine too!\nWritten by past host

    cars on the road, watching race videos, and more. He also loves rocks - from stone
    walls on mountain roads to digging up quartz to skimming stones on water. “Y”
    really enjoys playing soccer, and would like to improve his skills. He would enjoy
    learning other sports, too. He and “S” love rockets and would really like to ride
    in a boat. “Y” is a good brother to “S”, helping him on the playground or nudging
    him when it's time to brush his teeth or do a chore. \n\n“Y” is quiet at first,
    but when trust is established, he's helpful, engaging and funny. He wants to please
    and will do his best to accomplish whatever he's asked to do. “Y” is also very
    smart and insightful. He enjoys eating - his favorite foods are fruit, chicken
    with noodles, warm bread, cheese and sausage. He likes pizza and hamburgers, of
    course. He wants to succeed and has the ability to do so. “Y” has been starved
    for attention and will soak up all the love and positive attention a family gives
    him. He loves dogs and enjoys caring for them."

    “M” is the little brother of 659. Our team referred to him as the “Hello” boy because as we entered his village he was riding his bike and went past us several times to tell us a very sweet “hello”. He is an active little one who enjoys biking, sports, hockey. When asked if he liked to play floor hockey with the big kids he responded, “yes, but I can’t because I don’t have a stick”. He wants to be a basketball player when he grows up.

    U 1154 " O" is such a peach! He is the cutest little first grader who was so sweet, funny and cuddly. He had a huge smile that melted my heart, except when the camera was on! He listened well and waited politely for his turn, was kind to his little brother and older sister and very respectful to the teacher. He said his best friends are his siblings and loves playing with cars with them. He wants to learn how to ride a bike and have a chance to ride a roller coaster and a plane. This little fella loves animals but not so crazy about snakes. He is not a picky eater and says he likes everything. He would absolutely thrill at an opportunity to spend Christmas with a loving family.

    U 1162 ( former 1006 summer 2018) "N" is a super cool and fun boy. He was recommended by his teachers because he is  " a good boy and is trying so hard and is eager to travel." "N" did not get a chance to travel in the past and is hoping for Christmas miracle. This sweet boy is about to turn 16 this winter and is a last chance kid. He likes PE and math and loves any sport " that exists, soccer, volleyball, competitive swimming and tennis. I can even play baseball." He also loves animals, especially dogs and likes art and drawing.  'N" made such an impression on the team with his thoughtful answers and open contagious smile. He is friendly and gets along well with others, has lots of friends but his one true dream is a forever family. He LOVES babies and young children and would thrill at an opportunity to be a big brother or be in a family with kids his age. He is an outdoors-man and enjoys camping and fishing. he says he does not let his fears hold him down and overcame his fear of heights by " jumping off the tall bridge into the pool over and over until I was no longer scared". This polite and helpful boy sure would benefit from a chance to be hosted in America over Christmas.

    U 968- “K” is a funny, kind boy who plays soccer on the school team. He is an average student and likes ping pong and playing pool as well as drawing. He told our team that he doesn’t fight with his friends. He had a wonderful smile and hopes to be a taxi driver or a brick layer.

    U353- This little boy was brand new to the orphanage when our team met him. “S” likes to play outside and swing and slide. He likes both cats & dogs. He doesn't know what he wants to be when he grows up yet, but he is so lovable. He should be considered as a host only child at this time.

    U 1128. This little cutie was such a joy to interview and had amazing composure and manners for such a young little lady. According to her friend who was present during an interview, "A. is everyone's favorite because she is so nice and funny. She makes up and tells stories to younger kids and makes everyone laugh"   "A" is very new to her current school, but according to teachers, is remarkably well adjusted, listens well and is making a lot of friends. She is a third grader and this smart cookie is a good student who loves IT and technology class. She speaks Russian and Ukrainian but prefers Russian. "A" is artistic and loves to draw with pencils and loves animals, especially cats. She likes riding a bike and would love to learn to swim as she had never had an opportunity to do so.  Her wish is to " see the world from above and know what it feels like to fly". She say she is scared of snakes but otherwise has no fears. She is comfortable to play alone or with other kids and would love a chance to be part of the family. She wants to be IT/ software engineer when she grows up!  Go girl !  She has an older teen brother who will not be able to travel due to behavioral issues, please contact your regional coordinator for more details.

    K is a shy girl with many interests! She loves to be active, especially playing soccer or volleyball, swimming, or jumping and flipping on the trampoline. K also loves to bake and would likely enjoy decorating cookies and gingerbread houses. Expect her work to be nearly perfect! When she's not running or baking you can find her quietly working on 1000 piece puzzles or creating with perler beads. Bracelet making is another activity she enjoys! Like all teens she enjoys her technology time, keeping in touch with friends on social media, and YouTube video tutorials. Over the summer she taught herself to play a song on the piano thanks to YouTube! She enjoyed spending time with the family and desired everyone to participate in activities together. K would do great with a mom who could spend the time building her trust and confidence. Sisters of any age and younger brothers would be great, but she would be uncomfortable around older brothers. Previous host family is happy to discuss more details about this lovely girl!
