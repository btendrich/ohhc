    $650 scholarship!
    U 1162 ( former 1006 summer 2018) "N" is a super cool and fun boy. He was recommended by his teachers because he is  " a good boy and is trying so hard and is eager to travel." "N" did not get a chance to travel in the past and is hoping for Christmas miracle. This sweet boy is about to turn 16 this winter and is a last chance kid. He likes PE and math and loves any sport " that exists, soccer, volleyball, competitive swimming and tennis. I can even play baseball." He also loves animals, especially dogs and likes art and drawing.  'N" made such an impression on the team with his thoughtful answers and open contagious smile. He is friendly and gets along well with others, has lots of friends but his one true dream is a forever family. He LOVES babies and young children and would thrill at an opportunity to be a big brother or be in a family with kids his age. He is an outdoors-man and enjoys camping and fishing. he says he does not let his fears hold him down and overcame his fear of heights by " jumping off the tall bridge into the pool over and over until I was no longer scared". This polite and helpful boy sure would benefit from a chance to be hosted in America over Christmas.

    U862 (sibling of U863 and 864)
    "D" is a very caring, helpful young man. He is a wonderful big brother. He always made sure the younger siblings or children were taken care of before himself. He had a blast going to the beach, great with animals (especially loves dogs) playing out side, anything batman related, and playing cards or video games with the family. He is a skilled athlete at "football" and it would be his dream to ride in a Dodge Charger one day. He was an absolute joy to be around and loved to help in the kitchen with cooking too. D" spoke English very well, and has a smile that lights up the room and kept us all laughing with his charming fun personality

    U863 (sibling of U862 and U864)
    This little guy is full of spunk and big hugs. He loves super hero's and would put on a cape and run like "The Flash". He is full of energy and loved being outside playing in the backyard, going fishing, swimming, and playing with animals. He and his brother and sister would  all play "football" together and enjoyed playing games or watching cartoons in the evening to wind down. He would always offer to help carry in groceries and wanted to help in the kitchen with cooking and loves eating ice cream. At night, he liked to be tucked in and would play quietly in the morning till his big brother would wake up. "D"   is a fun little guy who wants to be a super hero when he  grows up and very well could be one day.

    U864 (sister of U863 and U862)
    "K" is so sweet and a tiny bit shy until you get to know her, then she is all giggles and grins. She loves playing dress-up, being pampered and cuddling up to read a story or watch a moving. She's very smart and loves learning new things like how to swim or read English. She quickly learned her ABC's in English and learned new words with ease. "K" is so easy going  and laid back. She loved to be girly, but would also play in the dirt with the boys. She would do wonderfully with another girl to play baby dolls with or to do arts and crafts. "K" would love to ride a horse one day and can't wait to come back to America again.

  :description: "$800 Scholarship!\nL105   (written by past host family): \nK is a
    sweet and adventurous girl.  She absolutely loves to try new things and even when
    she’s scared she will push through.  K got along with our entire family (we have
    3 kids ranging from 9-14 years old).  She absolutely adores dogs and cats.  Especially
    cats.  If you have a cat, then K is your girl. She is responsible and respectful.
    \ Her English is good, better than she gives herself credit.  K does everything
    in her power to communicate effectively.  She would do great with a family that
    spends time at home with occasional outings and adventures, because she does enjoy
    resting too.  She has brothers and she does worry about them, so hosting her with
    a brother or 2 would be best and I know she would help tremendously with their
    care.  K can have moments where her emotions overflow because she can be particular
    about things.  But after a few moments she moves on and is back to her normal
    self.  We love this girl and want nothing more than for her and her brothers to
    find a family."

    "A" says his friends would describe him as a "rascal". He is an active boy who likes cartoons, biking, rollerblading, basketball, jumping on the trampoline and to build houses, cars and airplanes with legos.

    a beautiful 15 year old boy who loves soccer, Minecraft, music, electronics and
    animals.  He is active, but mostly just wants to be engaged regardless of he activity!
    \ He is very shy around new people and was most comfortable and seemed to blossom
    with our immediate family.  His personality is silly, funny and sweet.  He is
    thoughtful and very sensitive, although he tries to hide his emotions with people
    he does not know.   O is very intelligent. He has taught himself how to fix electronics
    and build batteries!  I feel he was craving attention from both my husband and
    I. He would wait for my husband to come home and be there ready to say hello.
    O was helpful around the house, fed and walked the dogs, helped cook dinner and
    was able to entertain himself when I needed to complete chores around the house.
    This boy is really in need of a family that can give him a sense of safety. His
    behavior is mostly on par with his age, but at times his play and emotional age
    can present a little younger. O shared some of his past with us and his hopes

    orphanage a very short time and when asked how his friends would describe him
    he replied his one wish is to have a friend. He said his favorite class is writing
    and that he loves to read. He is half the size of his peers but he has a big personality
    and smile. He also said he would love to see presents around a tree. Could you
    be the one to show him the love of Jesus and family and friends this season?"

    and great presence. She has been in her current school for over a year and her
    teachers describe her " loving and fun and sweet but a so-so student "  She loves
    math, art and music. According to a director " She really really really wants
    to go and asks every day when will the interview team will come?"  She never had
    a chance to travel in the past and is looking forward to spending Christmas with
    a family. " V " loves music and " used to play violin and take dance lessons when
    I was little". Her dream is to become a violin player or massage/ physical therapist.
    She loves to play outside and prefers company of other girls. She loves Pizza,
    french fries and hot dogs. Speaking of dogs, she had a negative experience with
    a large dog while in foster care and she is uncomfortable around larger dogs as
    a result. She does not have any other fears and would be a joy to have as part
    of your family through the holiday season. She appears to have possible very mild
    cognitive delay that does not seem to affect her communication abilities or personality.

  :description: U852- “V” is a very pretty, personable girl. She is a little shy at
    first but starts to warm up and show her beautiful smile. Once she feels comfortable
    she is very talkative and sweet and told our team that she has heard so much about
    America from other kids who have traveled. She has a lot of friends at school
    and enjoys dancing. A family who traveled to her orphanage spoke of her love for
    animals, not one in particular, but all.  They also spoke of her kindness for
    others.  They took her to her first restaurant, ever, where she enjoyed an ice
    cream sundae. She would enjoy being hosted by any type of family. She likes to
    draw, listen to music and hopes to be a hairdresser someday. Our team commented
    on her super personality.

  :description: UK480 - "O"  is also very sweet and always smiling. He relies on his
    sister and translator apps, but we are coming to notice that he knows more English
    than he feels comfortable speaking. He is building confidence and speaking in
    English more to us each day. I think our feeble attempts at Russian may be boosting
    his confidence. He really likes board games and loves hide and seek! He enjoys
    riding bikes, being outdoors. and he swims well. He is very fond of American food.
    He enjoys the small things like a trip to the store or checking the mail, and
    he is always the first person out to the car to greet his host parents when they
    would arrive home.  His sister is UK479 "V"

    U 1127 . " M" is a sweet teen boy who is an older brother of U 1126. He is relatively new to this school but came highly recommended by staff due to his good nature. He never traveled before and would love a chance to spend Christmas with his brother in a Christian family. He brought tears to interview team eyes when he said he wishes he could eat potato pancakes one day again because that reminds him of his grandma who used to make them and who he loved very much. His not a picky eater but does not like liver :)  . He enjoys outdoors and would love a chance to go fishing. He is a good student and says he does not mind to follow directions and is " never in trouble because I listen well and like to help". He was calm, kind and patient as well as clearly protective and sweet with his little brother. He was respectful and tactful during interview and did not interrupt his brother at all ( he later corrected some statements his brother made but in a kind way as to not hurt his feelings.) When asked how his friends
     would describe him, he said " calm and share well with others". His one true wish was " forever family". He likes soccer, swimming and riding a bike. He likes cats and dogs and prefers family that has other children but " not too noisy". He says at times he gets overwhelmed by too much activity and likes quite time as well as sports.

  :description: U1126. I. is a sweet pre-teen boy who is a younger brother of U1127.
    He was a lot of fun and comes highly recommended by teachers. He was described
    by them as friendly, very compliant and " helpful, always trying to help and agrees
    with most things as to not upset people" He is relatively new to this orphanage
    but already won the hearts of his caregivers.  He had a strong connection with
    his brother during an interview and clearly looks up to him. "I." said he is very
    excited to travel and see " nice people". He wants to be an astronaut but does
    say he is scared of dark and will need a night light on when in space :). He loves
    cats and dogs and other kids but does say he prefers not to have a very large
    family as he ,at times , gets tired of a lot of noise and likes quite one on one
    time with few special people.  "I" might have mild speech processing delay as
    he answered yes to several questions that his older brother later clarified as
    incorrect. It does not prevent him at all from being kind and happy. Teachers
    described him as class favorite due to his good nature and kind disposition. He
    and his brother would benefit greatly from that one on one special time they crave

    confident and polite and sat patiently waiting for his turn. He says he loves
    Lego and loves animals. He says he is a " big boy and is scared of nothing" When
    asked what he likes to eat, he said salami and pastrami and candy, I could not
    agree more!  He has a lot of friends and gets along well with others. He likes
    riding a bike and says he can swim a little. He is excited about a possibility
    of traveling to US and said he was not concerned about flying or his ability to
    communicate as he knows how to read and wright. Overall, he was pure joy to interview
    and would make any families Christmas extra special. His twin brother is unable
    to travel as he has  disabilities and requires extra supervision.  Please consider

  :description: U 1147 "V" is a nice polite 3rd grader who is an older brother of
    U 1146. He has been in his current school for several years but never had a chance
    to travel. He was patient and radiated positive energy during the interview. He
    is a good student and likes to write. He says he loves to play with cars and Lego
    as well as eat apples, carrots,  buckwheat and pastrami. When asked if he has
    any fears, he said " super enormous spiders, otherwise nothing". Otherwise he
    loves animals and would enjoy a family with " lots of kids and pets". He wants
    to be a driver when he grows up and his dream is to have a family as well as a
    car he could drive his family around in. He says he is excited to see the ocean
    but not sure if he wants to swim in it " because that is where the sharks are".
    "V" was good with his little brother and was polite during an interview. He was
    somewhat active in the room, having to wait for his turn extended period of time,
    but not disruptive or disrespectful. He would be a blessing to a family during
    his holiday season.

  :description: "U1306, U1307\n\nTeam Favorite! Full of giggles and love for each
    other, you can tell this sibling set adores one another.\n“S” is an absolute sweetheart.
    He loves music of all kinds and was learning guitar until his strings broke. He
    had great communication skills and his responses were very open and honest.  He
    told us he would like to be a chef and little sister quickly broke into that conversation
    to tell a story about a cooking disaster involving his attempt to make eggs. He
    was a little embarrassed but agreed that he might need some cooking lessons. A
    boy with a tender heart for younger children, when a younger boy dropped all of
    his candy on the ground “S” replaced the candy with his own bag.\n”V” is a beautiful
    teenage girl who likes to listen to music with friends…and maybe take a selfie
    or two. She also enjoys creating hairstyles with her best friend.  She’s nervous
    around dogs (many dogs in her country are strays). When asked what her favorite
    food is she stated that she could live on sausage, bread, and water forever. \nThese
    joyful teen siblings would love to be part of a family this Christmas!  (And maybe
    have a cooking lesson or two.)"

    U627/214 (brother of U628/215)
    S is as cut energetic little boy. He loves to wrestle, play games, swim and cuddle. This kid is a cuddle bug! He likes to do math with his sister which is pretty impressive.  S does will with my boys,  but I think he would thrive if there wasn't a boy the same age as him in the house. He gets  along great with my 5 yr old and 2 yr old. Bot h the children love animals and  I think our dogs have been a comfort to them.

    U628/215 (sister of U627/214)
    D is an eleven yr old girl going on 16! She loves to shop, do her nails, crafts and swim. When she is shy in large groups, she light up at the house. She is smart, helpful, kind and all thing typical of a pre-teen girl. D does well with all the little kids in the house but I think she would thrive if she had a sister a few years older or younger than her. She does great with our 2 yr old. (D also has a 3 yr old sibling too young  to travel)

    U1008 (sister of U1007)
    D is a bouncing ball of sweetness! She has been a true blessing to our family this summer.  She was the baby in our house and got lots of extra attention. She has an older brother and interacts great with him with only minimal fighting. D loves to play outside on a swing set, bounce on a trampoline, and swim, but she is also able to sit still inside for hours painting, playing video games, or doing crafts. She is secure enough to go into  a Sunday school class on her won and loved VBS while her. She is a princess and loves to have her hair blown dry at night and styled in the morning. Pretty dress and glitter tennis shoes are a must! She listens well to  my son at night when he reads to he (Ukrainian Bible) and shows great comprehension skills. However, like her brother she struggles with reading and writing in her native language---yet she has picked up English great. She is somewhat of a pick eater. Over all she is a pure joy to be around and any family who hosts her will be blessed for sure!

    U1007 (brother of U1006)
    "I" is a sweet teen boy who enjoyed being in a family and craves attention. He will often grab our hands and hold them and gives big hugs. He interacts well with his sister with little fighting. I is a typical teenage boy in some ways -- He enjoys being outside jumping on the trampoline, going fishing, playing games like Jenga, and doing anything with water. He keeps his room very clean and helps around the house without being asked to. He especially enjoyed mowing the grass. and working in the garden. He is a great eater. "I" has limited literacy skills, and would benefit from a family that can spend additional time with his special needs. Past host family would be happy to speak to families about "I" and his sister.

    U1230, U1231


    These brothers made our team laugh… they were so excited to hear more about American foods and are dreaming of the chance to taste all different types; especially french fries.  Older brother, “S”, is confident and heard not only about American foods from friends but how exciting roller coasters are and he would love to ride one.  He enjoys being active and you can find him out on the soccer field when he is not in school.  His favorite class is Ukrainian language and he would appreciate an opportunity to improve his English.  Younger brother “Y” has a memorable smile that sets you at ease.  He is very friendly and enjoys being outside playing all types of sports.  He is sociable and has a lot of friends.  He loves to tinker and learn about how things work which is why he would like to become a mechanic when he grows up.  Could you invite these boys home to experience the love of a family this Christmas?  And of course, serve them french fries.

  :description: "1308, 1309, 1310 \n\nMeet “D”, “V”, and “A”! They’ve had a hard life
    and experienced more than any person ever should in just a few short years but
    despite their rough start they are moving forward with amazing courage. “D” is
    the older sister. Her favorite subject is geometry but her real passion is singing!
    She says that sometimes being the bigger sister can be tough; she feels very protective
    of her brothers and has felt pressure to keep them safe. But her little brother
    wants to hug her everyday and sometimes a girl just needs her space! “A” is the
    youngest of the three. He enjoys all things boy and is very happy that there are
    lots of boys his age to play with in the orphanage! His favorite subject is PE
    because he loves being able to play outside. During the interview he was given
    a few pieces of candy and later we saw him sharing his candy with some of the
    younger kids. He also received an ice cream from one of the caretakers and offered
    it to me when he realized I didn’t have one! He is truly an amazing kid with a
    huge heart! The middle sibling is “V”. During the official interview he was at
    a camp but one of our coordinators knows him well. She says that “V” is very kind.
    The way he carries himself and the care he takes with the other children in the
    orphanage caught her eye immediately. He is respectful with the caretakers and
    visitors and compassionate towards the younger children. He gets along well with
    everyone in the orphanage and was never seen teasing some of the children with
    disabilities. Like his little brother, “V” also enjoys being outside and playing
    with the other kids. His caretakers say he does well in school despite being slightly
    behind when he first arrived at the orphanage 1.5yrs ago. He also needed surgery
    last year to correct a vision problem but he didn’t let that slow him down! He’s
    making great strides and tries hard to do well. All three children have overcome
    so much but they are not letting their past define them. They continue to have
    hope that their future will be bright and they deserve the opportunity to learn
    about healthy family life this Christmas. We all know that this mission improves
    the lives of the children it serves but hosting these siblings this winter would
    forever change your family’s life in the best, most unimaginable ways possible."

  :description: U1303, U1304 (little guy too young to travel) These three boys are
    full of energy and smiles. The oldest boy is physically smaller than the middle
    brother but definitely in charge of all three. Their size and demeanor make them
    seem younger than their actual age. Middle brother loves Ninjago and older brother
    loves computer games like “Royal Quest”. Even though they have only been at the
    orphanage a short time they were very excited by the prospect of a trip to America.
    The youngest brother is too young to travel this year so only the older two are
    available for hosting currently. These boys would do well with a physically active
    family that could keep up with their boundless energy.

    U1225, U1226, U1227
    Easy to smile and laugh with our interview team, these beautiful sisters are very close, describing each other as best friends.  “Y” is the oldest.  She is a budding artist and enjoys drawing.  She would love the opportunity to discover other art mediums.  Her friends characterize her as helpful and trustworthy.  She also has a heart for caring for others which is why she would love to be a nurse.  She has a streak for adventure and would like to try new activities such as parachuting… maybe you can make a compromise and take her on a roller coaster? “L” is the middle sister.  She is very thoughtful and more reserved than her older sister.  Her favorite pastime is drawing.  She is very curious and likes to learn and does well in school.  She expressed the desire to learn to cook.  When we asked her what should dreams of doing, she answered, “Oh anything in America!” “O” is the baby of the group.  She is shy and kept flashing our team the sweetest smiles.  She adores taking care of younger children and is described as having a big heart and being kind to others.  She would like for a mom or dad to show her how to cook as she would like to be a chef when she grows up. What a sweet group of girls to bless your family this Christmas.  Could you welcome them into your family?

    (part of sibling set of four)
    "V"is a very sweet girl and loves art and reading.  She picked up on English so  quickly while here too! She also loves the outdoors and enjoys swimming, biking, jumping on the trampoline and coloring with chalk.  She did have some difficulty adjusting when she first arrived because she is used to being mom to her two younger siblings. After a couple weeks when she realized she could ease up on that responsibility,  she started treating them much more nicely.  Temper tantrums had been a problem but definitely decreased with time.

    This teen boy has a confidence that drew the interview team in immediately. He shared with us that he is very interested in computers and IT but also likes playing basketball and soccer. He loves to draw all kinds of things and is a bit of a perfectionist in trying to copy drawings he finds on the internet. He would prefer being in a small family but doesn’t really mind if the other kids are older or younger than him. His smile lit up the room but he would really shine in a family of his own. Could that be your family this Christmas?

    1301, 1302
    An easy-going sibling set with a sweet relationship. Big sister was the most talkative but both lit up and were excited to talk about their desire to visit an amusement park. Little brother declared himself not scared of anything and willing to ride the biggest and scariest ride while big sister said she would like to go but might be too scared to actually ride. Both kids like animals but she really loves cats. Both of them also love jumping on the trampoline and being outside. When asked to describe her brother she stated he is fun, kind and hard working. When asked to describe his sister he said that she is the boss and he doesn’t like it when she makes fun of his haircut. These two sweethearts would be so much fun this Christmas!

  :description: HOLD - LE 9/6 - L38 & 39 are two kind boys we've practically watched
    grow up over the years.  Older brother "A" is a friendly, fun-loving boy who likes
    to watch movies like Harry Potter, or spend time with friends.  He speaks English
    well.  Another host mom who knows him describes him as, "kindhearted, friendly,
    and eager to please. He’s not afraid to show you his humor and spunk though! He
    will fill your winter with adventure and keep you on your toes but also has a
    kind and gentle side that desires a strong relationship with a mom figure." He
    enjoys video games, Pokémon Go! and fortnight. He also likes to swim in the local
    rivers. Younger brother "J"  loves his art class.  He also likes soccer and IronMan,
    and hopes to become a policeman someday.  He likes pets and animals, but admits
    spiders creep him out!   Their wish is to go to America and have a nice family.  Could
    that be your family?

    V is an absolutely wonderful girl. She loves hugs and attention. In many ways she is a tomboy, but also loves to do nails, hair and makeup. She is pretty good at sports and can challenge any boy. She can be very good with small children and many times is willing to help out with them. She is very responsible and can be trusted with the household. Although sometimes she gets loud with her sister, there has never been a problem resolving any disagreements between them. She is also  very brave and many time is up to trying new things. In her spare time V enjoys listening to music and reading books. Would be a great fit with any family, and especially enjoys kids near her age.

She is also very talented at cross-stitch. (She told us she taught herself!) She interacts well with young children, enjoys goofing off and playing wit them, but does seem to get annoyed when they cry or act up. She would do well in a family with kiddoes' around her age. h ultimately just wants to be loved and, given time, I think she has the ability to adapt to any family. N tests the boundaries a little bit, but I think that is just typical for her age. She complies to the rules after a few unsuccessful attempts to sway us. She is easy to love and fun to be around.

    really enjoys playing soccer, and would like to improve his skills. He would enjoy
    learning other sports, too. He and “S” love rockets and would really like to ride
    in a boat. “Y” is a good brother to “S”, helping him on the playground or nudging
    him when it's time to brush his teeth or do a chore. \n\n“Y” is quiet at first,
    but when trust is established, he's helpful, engaging and funny. He wants to please
    and will do his best to accomplish whatever he's asked to do. “Y” is also very
    smart and insightful. He enjoys eating - his favorite foods are fruit, chicken
    with noodles, warm bread, cheese and sausage. He likes pizza and hamburgers, of
    course. He wants to succeed and has the ability to do so. “Y” has been starved
    for attention and will soak up all the love and positive attention a family gives
    him. He loves dogs and enjoys caring for them."

    A” is a young boy who we first met this fall when he had just arrived at this  orphanage.  It was great to meet him again and see how his is settling in. He likes to play outside, particularly with cars or soccer. He's afraid of dogs and does prefer to play by himself at times. He expressed that it would be a little bit scary to travel to America-----so a family who is sensitive to his needs would be best. He is interested in learning how to ride a bike---what fun that would be this summer.
